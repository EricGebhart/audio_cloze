# audio_cloze
Anki addon that changes the behavior of audio inside clozes to be consistent with the textual behavior.


The non visible clozes do not make any sound.  If an audio hint is desired for a cloze, place the audio in the hint for that cloze. Multiple sounds can be added to the answer or the hint.

This addon allows for complete control over audio in notes which have multiple clozes.
