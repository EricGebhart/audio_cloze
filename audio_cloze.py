Description: Changes the behavior of clozes which contain audio to be
            consistent with the behavior of text within clozes. ie. The non
            visible clozes do not make any sound.  If an audio hint is desired
            for a cloze, place the audio in the hint for that cloze. Multiple
            sounds can be added to the answer or the hint.
